  <h2 title="Hello there">About me...</h2>

  <p>I’m a displaced West Country bumpkin living in Leeds who’s hoping the PhD I’m currently enrolled on will allow me to say with certainty that I’m a ‘former’ geography teacher.
  I’m a closet crafter, avid reader and owner of the cutest cava-shell named Bear.</p>

  <p>I enjoy travelling (but then who doesn’t?) and while I can’t do the month-long tours I was able to as a teacher I hope my 4 years as a research student are peppered with weekend breaks to interesting European cities. </p>

  <p>The Assignment 1 page outlines the requirements of the 30% portion of assessment for <abbr title="Programming for Social Science: Core Skills">GEOG5995M</abbr>, and details the programming that went into the agent based model that was generated throughout the lecture series.</p>

  <p>The Something Extra is an authentic Sri Lankan pineapple curry recipe that is quick, easy and full of flavour. I add it not because it’s relevant, it isn’t… at all, but rather because it’s delicious and everyone should try it.</p>
